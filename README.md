## Requirements

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) account

## Installation Steps (if applicable)

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm install discord.js`
4. Run `npm install node-fetch`
5. Run `node index.js`
6. Interact with your Discord bot via your web browser

## Optional
1.The code uses fs which is a JS library that lets you read or write to files. I do use the fs library in the code to import all of the command modules in index.js, so you can run npm install fs
##Commands
1.The commands that are programmed in this bot are the ping, pong, rate, weather and trigger commands.
2.The weather command takes the JSON data from a weather api and processes that data
3.The trigger command takes the JSON data from a news api, and seaches the data for Fox News articles to torture people
